        Where do bad folks go when they die?<br>
        They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Go<br>
        to a lake of fire and fry See 'em again 'til<br>
        the Fourth of July.

        I knew a lady who came from Duluth Bitten<br>
        by a dog with a rabid tooth She went to her<br>
        grave just a little too soon Flew away howling<br>
        on the yellow moon.
